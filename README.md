statedecoded-parser
===================

Parser for State Decoded from Municode source XML


The ruby parser xml-parser converts a Municode XML raw dump into individual law files in XML.

This was an initial attempt to get files into the State Decoded site for Miami.  It should only be used as a reference, as the parser has certain flaws which 
does not make it suitable for long term use.
